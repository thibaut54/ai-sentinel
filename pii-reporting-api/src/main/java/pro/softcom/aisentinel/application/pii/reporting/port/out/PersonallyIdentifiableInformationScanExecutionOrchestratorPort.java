/**
 * Output port for managing scan tasks decoupled from SSE connections.
 * 
 * <p>This port enables scans to continue executing independently of SSE connections.
 * Scans are identified by a unique ID and can have multiple simultaneous subscribers.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Start a new scan and return its identifier</li>
 *   <li>Allow subscription to an existing scan via its ID</li>
 *   <li>Pause/stop an active scan</li>
 *   <li>Manage scan lifecycle (automatic cleanup after 1 hour TTL)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Guarantees:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A scan continues even if all SSE subscribers disconnect</li>
 *   <li>New subscribers can receive past events (replay buffer of 1000 events)</li>
 *   <li>Thread-safe for concurrent access</li>
 * </ul>
