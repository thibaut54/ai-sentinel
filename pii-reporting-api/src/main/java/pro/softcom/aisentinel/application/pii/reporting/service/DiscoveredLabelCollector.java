/**
 * Accumulates open-vocabulary labels discovered by the MINISTRAL detector.
 *
 * <p>Business purpose: collects the labels the model proposes outside the
 * configured vocabulary so an operator can review and promote them later.
 *
 * <p>This collector is invoked from the scan flux on a background scheduler.
 * It is self-contained and fail-open: it no-ops on empty input and swallows
 * persistence failures (logged at warn) so label collection can never make the
 * scan itself fail.
 *
 * <p>Collection is gated by {@code enabled}: disabled by default so no discovered
 * labels are persisted in production. The strict type filtering that drops those
 * unconfigured labels lives in the detector service and is independent of this
 * gate; it always applies. Enable only for debugging the model's proposed
 * vocabulary.
