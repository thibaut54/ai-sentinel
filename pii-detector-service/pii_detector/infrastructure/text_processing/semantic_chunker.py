    chunking upstream may leave chunks that exceed the word limit on dense input
    (URLs, identifiers, code), causing GLiNER to silently truncate beyond
    ``max_len`` and drop entities at the tail.

    This chunker reproduces the exact regex GLiNER uses
    (``\\w+(?:[-_]\\w+)*|\\S``) to count whitespace tokens, so configuring
    ``chunk_size`` strictly below ``max_len`` guarantees no internal truncation.

    Char positions are taken from the regex match offsets, keeping
